
This directory contains Mathematica programs that generate both the figures
in the Endogenous Gridpoints paper.

To generate the micro figures, open the notebook MicroPlot.nb and execute it
To generate the macro figures, open the notebook MacroPlot.nb and execute it

A bonus file is MacroSSCompare.nb, which calculates the perfect foresight steady state
and compares the numerical solution to this.  Corresponding dervations are in
MacroSSCompare.tex
