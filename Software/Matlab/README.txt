These programs were originally written by Zhou Lu under the guidance from 
professor Christopher Carroll.  
In professor Carroll's paper, Method of Endogenous Gridpoints is applied to 
macro models and micro models.  Accordingly, programs here can be run in 
macro versions or micro versions.First start MATLAB,then download programs 
to the folder that is set by MATLAB as the "Current Directory".  To run macro 
version, first run "macroparams", then "common". To run micro version, first
"microparams' and then "common". These programs are supposed to produce 
interpolation data matrices of consumption C and wealth  M for 100 periods.

The programs were modified by Michael Reiter in July 2005 to improve their speed.
